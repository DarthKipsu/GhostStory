				<p class='text'>Before we start, would you be so kind to give me the name and age of your game character?</p>

				<input type='text' id='age-input' placeholder='Your age'></input>

			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel2">
				<p class='text'>It's pitch black outside. Cold, dark, muddy. If you woudn't know better, you could hardly call it a winter. You get home from work, too late again, and hungry. At least it's friday, finally!</p>
				<p class='text'>As soon as you get settled inside, you feel as something's wrong. You feel like you're not alone - and you're right.</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(2,3)'>Look behind you</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel3">
				<p class='text'>You see a shape in the back of the living room, as pale as snow. It quivers and sneezes silently, looking at you with timid eyes.</p>
				<p class='text'>There should be no one in the house except for you and you've never seen this person before in your life anyway. What will you do?</p>
				<select>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(3,4)'>Shout out of fright "How did you get here?"</option>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(3,5)'>Take a broom next to you and try to hit it</option>

			<div class="story" id="panel4">
				<p class='text'>"A bat brought me here, sir" the white little man replied. "I'm so glad you came home, I was starting to wonder if I'm in the wrong house."</p>
				<p class='text'>"Well, I think you still are!" you shout, "what are you doing in my house?"</p>
				<p class='text'>"I will tell you, but you must calm down first or you won't believe me."</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(4,7)'>Calm down a bit</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel5">
				<p class='text'>You try to hit him with the first thing you could reach - a broom. His fast though and after your swing, you feel the whole house shake a bit.</p>
				<p class='text'><span class="scream">"SKRIIIIEEEEK"</span> he screams with a high pitch, raising your hackles up.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel6">
				<p class='text'>"Are you alright?" you ask the little man.</p>
				<p class='text'>You take a closer look and notice you can see through him if you try. White, wavy and transparent. Can it be?</p>
				<p class='text'>"Oh, I'm sorry. I must have catched a cold coming down here" he says quietly, lurking in the shadows.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel7">
				<p class='text'>"It's allright to get alarmed the first time you meet your house ghost after all," he said.</p>
				<p class='text'>A ghost? He does look a bit wawy and grizzled, like a shadow of a man.</p>
				<p class='text'>"Yes. It's new for me aswell, but you see I was sent here to be the house ghost because the spectre who was here earlier left."</p>
				<select class="no-margin">
					<option onclick='switchPanel(7,8)'>"A spectre?"</option>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(7,9)'>"There's been no hounting here before you!"</option>
				</select>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel8">
				<p class='text'>"Yes, spectres have the first choice on houses, but he thought your place was low and you had such a bad wine, he left the third day," the ghost explained.</p>
				<p class='text'>"Then after the spectre has left, a phantom will visit the house. That's me. And if I leave, a gobling, then an elf and lastly a ghoul, if nothing else is left."</p>
				<select class="no-margin">
					<option onclick='switchPanel(8,15)'>"What do you mean my place is low?"</option>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(8,8)'>"Well, you're not a very scary phantom."</option>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(8,8)'>"There will be no goblins or elves in my house!"</option>
				</select>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel9">
				<p class='text'>"No?" he looks around in mistrust. "I would think you'd notice somethig like a spectre in the house. Are you sure?"</p>
				<select>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(9,10)' class="myName">"As sure as my name is </option>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(9,11)'>"Unless spectres are hard to miss!"</option>

			<div class="story" id="panel10">
				<p class='text' id="myName2">"Oh...." He sounded confused. "If your name is </p>
				<p class='text'>He kept a long pause.</p>
				<p class='text' id="theirName">"I'm on a wrong house, am I! Are you sure you're name isn't </p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(10,12)'>"Pretty sure, yeah."</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel11">
				<p class='text'>"No, spectres are the high class of fiends. You would have been scared if a spectre was here," he assured.</p>
				<p class='text'>"I can truthfully say, I haven't noticed anything," you say, doubting if the ghost knew anything off what he was talking about. He starts to glide around looking at the house more precisely.</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(11,14)'>Follow the ghost</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel12">
				<p class='text'>"Well then, how come you didn't say so earlier?" the ghost replied with frustration in his voice. "I've been here for nothing!"</p>
				<p class='text'>"You never asked my name!" you shout.</p>
				<p class='text'>He looks at you with wary eyes, "you are right. My apologies. I must be on my way now, maybe they will send you a better sprite to hount you so you'll be in constant fright. Good night!"</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(12,13)'>You watch the ghost dissappear</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel13">
				<p class='text'>Though the friendly ghost has often been in your mind, you haven't been visited by any kind of ghost, sprite, or poltergeist. since.</p>
				<p class='text'>You wonder if it was all just a dream...</p>
				<button onclick='window.location.reload()'>Go again!</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel14">
				<p class='text'>"There doesn't seem to be much wrong with this house," he mutters. "It's like a spectre was never here, as you say."</p>
				<p class='text'>"Told you so," you reply, feeling relieved.</p>
				<p class='text' id="theirName2">, how old is this house?" he asks.</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(14,10)' class="myName">"About two years and my name is </button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel15">
				<p class='text'>"Well, a new house needs a lot of work to make it good," he thought. "You need to drill a lot of holes and losen screws to make it squeak and creak correctly, you know!"</p>
				<p class='text'>"No I certainly don't!" you exclaim. "Have you been loosening screws here while I've been at work?"</p>
				<p class='text'>"I have not, that would've been unpolite."</p>
				<p class='text'>Believe him? 
				<button class="small" onclick='switchPanel(15,15)'>Yes</button> 
				<button class="small" onclick='switchPanel(15,15)'>No</button></p>
