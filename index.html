			<div class="story" id="panel2">
				<p class='text'>It's pitch black outside. Cold, dark, muddy. If you woudn't know better, you could hardly call it a winter. You get home from work, too late again, and hungry. At least it's friday, finally!</p>
				<p class='text'>As soon as you get settled inside, you feel as something's wrong. You feel like you're not alone - and you're right.</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(2,3)'>Look behind you</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel3">
				<p class='text'>You see a shape in the back of the living room, as pale as snow. It quivers and sneezes silently, looking at you with timid eyes.</p>
				<p class='text'>There should be no one in the house except for you and you've never seen this person before in your life anyway. What will you do?</p>

				<p class='text'>"A bat brought me here, sir" the white little man replied. "I'm so glad you came home, I was starting to wonder if I'm in the wrong house."</p>
				<p class='text'>"Well, I think you still are!" you shout, "what are you doing in my house?"</p>
				<p class='text'>"I will tell you, but you must calm down first or you won't believe me."</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(4,7)'>Calm down a bit</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel5">
				<p class='text'>You try to hit him with the first thing you could reach - a broom. His fast though and after your swing, you feel the whole house shake a bit.</p>
				<p class='text'><span class="scream">"SKRIIIIEEEEK"</span> he screams with a high pitch, raising your hackles up.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel6">
				<p class='text'>"Are you alright?" you ask the little man.</p>
				<p class='text'>You take a closer look and notice you can see through him if you try. White, wavy and transparent. Can it be?</p>
				<p class='text'>"Oh, I'm sorry. I must have catched a cold coming down here" he says quietly, lurking in the shadows.</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(6,28)'>"Come on out, don't just shiver there!"</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel7">
				<p class='text'>"It's allright to get alarmed the first time you meet your house ghost after all," he said.</p>
				<p class='text'>A ghost? He does look a bit wawy and grizzled, like a shadow of a man.</p>
				<p class='text'>"Yes. It's new for me aswell, but you see I was sent here to be the house ghost because the spectre who was here earlier left."</p>
				<select class="no-margin">
					<option onclick='switchPanel(7,8)'>"A spectre?"</option>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(7,9)'>"There's been no hounting here before you!"</option>

			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel8">
				<p class='text'>"Yes, spectres have the first choice on houses, but he thought your place was low and you had such a bad wine, he left the third day," the ghost explained.</p>
				<p class='text'>"Then after the spectre has left, a phantom will visit the house. That's me. And if I leave, a gobling, then an elf and lastly a ghoul, if nothing else is left."</p>
				<select class="no-margin">
					<option onclick='switchPanel(8,15)'>"What do you mean my place is low?"</option>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(8,23)'>"There will be no goblins or elves in my house!"</option>
				</select>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel9">
				<p class='text'>"No?" he looks around in mistrust. "I would think you'd notice somethig like a spectre in the house. Are you sure?"</p>
				<select>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(9,10)' class="myName">"As sure as my name is </option>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(9,11)'>"Unless spectres are hard to miss!"</option>

			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel10">
				<p class='text' id="myName2">"Oh...." He sounded confused. "If your name is </p>
				<p class='text'>He kept a long pause.</p>
				<p class='text' id="theirName">"I'm on a wrong house, am I! Are you sure you're name isn't </p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(10,12)'>"Pretty sure, yeah."</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel11">
				<p class='text'>"No, spectres are the high class of fiends. You would have been scared if a spectre was here," he assured.</p>
				<p class='text'>"I can truthfully say, I haven't noticed anything," you say, doubting if the ghost knew anything off what he was talking about. He starts to glide around looking at the house more precisely.</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(11,14)'>Follow the ghost</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel12">
				<p class='text'>"Well then, how come you didn't say so earlier?" the ghost replied with frustration in his voice. "I've been here for nothing!"</p>
				<p class='text'>"You never asked my name!" you shout.</p>
				<p class='text'>He looks at you with wary eyes, "you are right. My apologies. I must be on my way now, maybe they will send you a better sprite to hount you so you'll be in constant fright. Good night!"</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(12,13)'>You watch the ghost dissappear</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel13">
				<p class='text'>Though the friendly ghost has often been in your mind, you haven't been visited by any kind of ghost, sprite, or poltergeist. since.</p>
				<p class='text'>You wonder if it was all just a dream...</p>
				<button onclick='window.location.reload()'>Go again!</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel14">
				<p class='text'>"There doesn't seem to be much wrong with this house," he mutters. "It's like a spectre was never here, as you say."</p>
				<p class='text'>"Told you so," you reply, feeling relieved.</p>
				<p class='text' id="theirName2">, how old is this house?" he asks.</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(14,10)' class="myName">"About two years and my name is </button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel15">
				<p class='text'>"Well, a new house needs a lot of work to make it good," he thought. "You need to drill a lot of holes and losen screws to make it squeak and creak correctly, you know!"</p>
				<p class='text'>"No I certainly don't!" you exclaim. "Have you been loosening screws here while I've been at work?"</p>
				<p class='text'>"I have not, that would've been unpolite."</p>
				<p class='text'>Believe him? 
				<button class="small" onclick='switchPanel(15,16)'>Yes</button> 
				<button class="small" onclick='switchPanel(15,22)'>No</button></p>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel16">
				<p class='text'>"Fine. Eveything seems to be in condition, but if I'll find something has got worn out..." you really have no idea what you could do in that situation. Against a ghost.</p>
				<p class='text'>"It's not, I assure you," he defended himself. "I should have left when you were late but it's raining so hard, I waited, by Knight-Mayor's permission of course."</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(16,17)'>"Knight-Mayor? Who's that?"</button> 
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel17">
				<p class='text'>"You must know him, his very popular these days," the ghost explained. "His the one who sits on people at night and pinches and pokes their stomach after they have eaten too much."</p>
				<p class='text'>"Popular. That's one way to put it," you raise your eyebrows.</p>
				<select>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(17,18)'>You'll feeling hungry, offer the ghost some food</option>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(17,21)'>Continue listening to the story</option>
				</select>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel18">
				<p class='text'>"Talking about food, I'm starving," you sigh looking how late it is. "How about I fix us something to eat... Or how does it work with ghosts? Can you eat?"</p>
				<p class='text'>"Oh yes! Indeed we phantoms love eating!" he says, excited.</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(18,19)'>Cook some duck and peas for both of you</button> 
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel19">
				<p class='text'>"Thank you for the food, despite the fact it wasn't all that delicious," he says afterwards.</p>
				<p class='text'>"You know, you're one of a kind in arrogance," you smirk while collectig the plates.</p>
				<p class='text'>"I'm sorry but I can see why the spectre left. You really should get better wine!" the phantom recommends, adding "and some sort of flavoring is usually used in dishes!"</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(19,20)'>"You're welcomed..."</button> 
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel20">
				<p class='text'>"I can see my welcome has expired, it's allright, in any case I must be on my way," he says and gets up while pouring himself one last glass of the bad wine you were serving him.</p>
				<p class='text'>"Will I be seeing goblins next?" you ask feeling annoyed and a bit scared on what follows.</p>
				<p class='text'>"Who knows. It's been nice to chat with you though," he grants. "Either way, good night!"</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(20,13)'>You watch the ghost dissappear</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel21">
				<p class='text'>"The Mayor's extremely fat, which suits his job well," he reasons. "When he was elected mayor he ran in exitment to the King, and for that effort, for such a big figure, the King knighted him on the spot!"</p>
				<p class='text'>"What a stroke of wit!" you rejoice.</p>
				<p class='text'>"It  was <span id="theirName3"></span>, wasn't it!" he replies. "And wouldn't you have done the same?"</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(21,10)' class="myName">"Sure, but my name is </button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel22">
				<p class='text'>"Like you haven't!" you feel frustrated. "What else would you have done here? Admire my books collection?"</p>
				<p class='text'>"I haven't touched anything, certainly not your books! I assure you," he defended himself. "I should have left when you were late but it's raining so hard, I waited, by Knight-Mayor's permission of course."</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(22,17)'>"Knight-Mayor? Who's that?"</button> 
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel23">
				<p class='text'>"Whether we ghosts stay or leave depends on circumstances, as with spectres, though we can't be as picky," he sighs.</p>
				<p class='text'>"You're like the middle class of demons?"</p>
				<p class='text'>"Eh, not exactly. But I do wish I would have born as a spectre," he said pensive.</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(23,24)'>"Don't we all."</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel24">
				<p class='text'>"So there's no chance I could have my house, like... back?" you ask. "Like no haunting of any kind?"</p>
				<p class='text'>"Well we can't just leave a house alone if the subject asks," he thinks about it for a moment. "This is always done in villas, however cheap. We get our assignments then we might move on, but the practice has to be maintained."</p>
				<select class="no-margin">
					<option onclick='switchPanel(24,15)'>"First you call the house low, now cheap?"</option>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(24,25)'>"But not all villas are haunted!"</option>
				</select>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel25">
				<p class='text'>"Some phantoms are less effective than others," the ghost explained. "And not all are so interested in talking to humans at all."</p>
				<p class='text'>"I wouldn't mind that kind of ghost..." you say. "Though maybe I'm just too hungry and tired for this today."</p>
				<p class='text'>"I'm hungry aswell, maybe we could fix us something to eat?"</p>
				<select class="no-margin">
					<option onclick='switchPanel(25,19)'>Cook something for the both of you</option>
					<option onclick='switchPanel(25,26)'>"I'll cook you if you promise no more haunting here."</option>
				</select>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel26">
				<p class='text'>"It's not really up to me as I said," he says regretting.</p>
				<p class='text'>"I'm sure an influential ghost like yourself can work something out..." you entice.</p>
				<p class='text'>"I can't promise you anything," he says.</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(26,27)'>Cook him something anyway</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel27">
				<p class='text'>"It wasn' that bad and I could sure spend some more time here cattering, but I think I must be going," he says after the dinner.</p>
				<p class='text'>"I guess ghosts have schedules to keep up with aswell."</p>
				<p class='text'>"Indeed, good night my friend!" he says and nods.</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(27,13)'>You watch the ghost dissappear</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel28">
				<p class='text'>"I'd rather not," he says timidly. "For phantoms have just as good reason being afraid of light, as men have to fear the dark."</p>
				<p class='text'>"So no reason at all," you reply  smiling kindly.</p>
				<p class='text'>"I'm not very good at this domestic haunting, am I..." he ponders. "I'm sorry, for it's my first assignment of this kind."</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(28,29)'>"Then what are you good at?"</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel29">
				<p class='text'>"I've been haunting in deserted castles and caverns!" he says proudly.</p>
				<p class='text'>"Must have been lonely jobs?" you ask.</p>
				<p class='text'>"Not at all for there's been other ghosts and sprites," he explains. "I've actually trained to be quite good at riddles! Want to play?"</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(29,30)'>Sure! Play a game of riddles with the ghost</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel30">
				<p class='text'>"Best of three to win?" he asks.</p>
				<p class='text'>"Sounds fair."</p>
				<p class='text'>"I'll start, but I'll go easy to see your level," he grants. "Are you ready?"</p>
				<button onclick='switchPanel(30,31)'>"I'm ready!"</button>
			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel31">
				<p class='text'>"What has a bed, but never sleeps."</p>
				<p class='text'>"Can run, but can never walk."</p>

			</div>
			<div class="story" id="panel32">
				<p class='text'>"Well guessed! It was <span id="first-answer"></span>," he said, evaluating if it was a good guess or were you just better a this game than you let know.</p>
				<p class='text'>"Now it's your turn. Remember, no cheating!"</p>
				<p class='text'>You think about it a bit. You haven't practiced the game like the ghost, so it takes a bit more effort from you.</p>

			<div class="story" id="panel33">
				<p class='text'>"Well, you didn't get it this time..." he says, feeling kind of happy about it. "I'll go easier next time, but now it's your turn!"</p>
				<p class='text'>You think about it a bit. You haven't practiced the game like the ghost, so it takes a bit more effort from you.</p>

			<div class="story" id="panel34">
				<p class='text'>"Close! The real answer was a river..." he thinks about it a bit and smiles friendly. "Since this was your first try and you allmost got it, let's count a point for you, allright?"</p>
				<p class='text'>"Suits for me! Now it's my turn..." you think about it a bit. You haven't practiced the game like the ghost, so it takes a bit more effort from you.</p>
